# Email Validator
-----------
## Project Description
The email validator takes a comma-separated list of email addresses and uses regular expressions to test them one by one. If the emails are in a valid format then the user sees the email displayed in green. However, if the email is not valid the user sees the email in red and is given feedback about what they need to do to make a valid email address. The validator has two modes, normal and strict, strict mode removes additional special characters and disallows double full stops. 

### This Project Explores
- Dynamic styling with PHP
- Using building complex regex expressions and using `preg_match`
- Managing user input
- Valid formatting for emails

### Notes
- To run this file locally you will require a local server, during development I used XAMPP to run an Apache server.
